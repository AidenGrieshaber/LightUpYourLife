Genre/Story/Mechanics Summary - 
The player is a spirit that overlooks a city, but the city is dark and gloomy causing everyone in the city to be sad. You as a spirit want to solve this issue so you are lighting up the whole city from house to house.
Each level takes place on a static screen, where the player can see an entire unlit room. The player will have a limited number of light fixtures that they can use on their hotbar.  Each light fixture has an “area of effect” (of varying shapes and sizes) showing how much light they cast in the room. Using the lights, the player will need to light up as much floor space as possible within the time limit. Once all of the lights have been placed in the room, the player receives a score based on the percentage of the room that was lit up during that attempt.
Minimal Viable Interaction - 
Ability to drag and drop lamps into the room.
A functional level in a grid space
A tracker for how much of the room is lit
Basic lighting to show what parts of the room are lit
